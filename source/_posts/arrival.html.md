The Geneva airport is not poorly designed, works well enough to get through from plane to train into the city. Not enough maps though, had to resort to the phone directions. 

The mountainscape was an impressive view, I hope to take it all in later. Ah, the humidity is wonderful, overcast but muggy, what a pleasure!

Train tunnel graffiti is a familiar and welcome sight. More thoughts later, not sure when exactly is my stop.
