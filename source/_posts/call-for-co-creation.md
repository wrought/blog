Hey all,

Please see this as an open and serious invitation, in a timely hour, to co-create The Omni (aka Omni Oakland Collective, Omni Commons, OMNI, etc):
http://omni-oakland.org

YOU have the opportunity (right now) to not merely participate in, but co-create a new commons in Oakland. In fact, it cannot be formed without you--this is an all-hands-on-deck moment.

Sudo Room, the creative community and hackerspace of my membership, is only one part of the Omni Collective. Even as broad as sudo room's scope (you can hack anything--language, food, culture, bureaucracy, software, hardware, wetware, institutions, your friends, your nose!), there are yet other interest groups that have open calls as well.

Over the years I have been touched by the works, presences, stories, experiences, and exchanges of so many people in the bay area. I am asking you now to be inclined to join us, either in person or at least in essence.

Consider this as an opportunity to celebrate the larger (even global) network of existent and emerging communities and physical spaces (places) who and which value, at heart, the interests of people and not vacuous things like profit through exploitation.

We need you now.

You can join through member collectives that are open:

Through our freshly empowered Omni Collective working groups:

Or as a new member collective:

Contact me directly in order to have support to become involved.

Love and solidarity,
Matt
