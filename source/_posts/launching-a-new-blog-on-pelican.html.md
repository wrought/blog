Trying my first post :D

[Pelican](http://getplican.com) turned out to be a bit of a pain in the ass. No holds barred here, startup was fairly annoying and would probably be much harder for folks /completely/ unfamiliar with python applications.

I stepped into the [quick-start walkthrough](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.2/getting_started.html#installing-pelican), borrowed a few components from pelicanconf.py configuration files on the web, checked out available [pelican-themes](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes), and settled on a slight remix of [Just-Read](http://github.com/shreeshga/just-read-theme.git) used on [chippedprism](http://www.chippedprism.com/) (at least to start).

So why go through with it?

I have a several goals:

1.  Try to write more HTML5
2.  Reap benefits &amp; low overhead of static content sites
3.  Adopt a community-used tool for saving time/energy and using handy features
4.  Strengthen my markdown skills
5.  Leverage VIM more often for writing long-form text
