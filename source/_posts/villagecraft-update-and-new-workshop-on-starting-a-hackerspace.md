Just met up with Hayley from [Villagecraft.org](http://villagecraft.org/) at sudo room. Got some updates about the progress of their project, including some exciting patterns from their user base and general solidarity across creative/learning community life!

Zero<sup>th</sup>, they're hosting a Dinner Party this Thursday June 12th at 6pm, register on villagecraft itself to join.

First, they're going _open source_, which means they'll finally be publishing their source code online, opening up the prospect of review, contribution, and creativity with the very platform that runs the villagecraft website. They support a community of hosts and attendees sharing knowledge at workshop-style events in the east bay area. This is certainly a project [sudoers](https://lists.sudoroom.org/) will be interested in examining more closely.

Second, they have a __plan__ ;). Meaning, they've got a list of features _and_ a list of bugs that they plan to get through to truly improve the villagecraft experience. Hayley spends a lot of time in the field, doing manual coordination, listening, and problem-solving. The results of her lessons she shares back to the rest of the team, most of whom write the bulk of the villagecraft software.

Third, and finally, the future is uncertain! New folks are getting on board to write software, and the organic user community is growing in interesting and strange ways (more on that below). There are open questions, big opportunities, and a clear need to grow wider (and not necessarily spend too much time going so deep). Hayley reached out on this particular accord, hoping to include more participation from hackerspace, techie, hardware/software/wetware communities. It seems to me the opportunity to cross sudo room's events and villagecraft's community platform is certainly real, and very exciting.

As for these user patterns. Two things Hayley shared are:
1. The villagecraft user base is growing inter-connected as an organic community.
2. Some of their users take several workshops across domains, rather than focus on individual domains.

These patterns seem to imply that the time to widen and grow the community is nigh. Further, the intuitive notion that users will pursue learning experiences based on the domain-specificity of their interests may very well be untrue thusfar!

Lastly, Hayley, Jeremy, and I shared some of our interests and experiences working in creative communities, using consensus, using safe space, positioning do-ocracy over bureaucracy, celebrating good-faith collaboration, and confronting bad-faith participants. As a result of our discussion, looks like I'll be hosting a workshop on [Starting a Hackerspace](http://villagecraft.org/w/3c71912c-starting-a-hackerspace), based on the [sudo room](https://sudoroom.org/) experience, conversations with folks starting hackerspaces locally as well as remotely, and my recent post on an off-the-cuff protocol: [8 steps to start a hackerspace](http://existenceproof.net/zero-to-hackerspace-in-eight-steps/). Additionally, Jeremy will be hosting one on _Consensus Process_, which we all agreed is much needed and even long-overdue.

Very exciting ;).
