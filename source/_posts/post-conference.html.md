The train is nearly silent. There is a faint whistle, but quieter even than a rachetless-casette bike-ride through sparsely populated hills. I am on my way to Lausanne from Geneva, North of the lake. Tomorrow I will catch a bus to Berlin, which I now regret&mdash;who knows if I will get to sleep on the overnight ride, ha! Hopefully it will be worth the $70 savings? Heh, only one way to see.

## Hack the Planet

I plan to visit [fixme](http://fixme.ch/), a hackerspace in Lausanne. While in Geneva, I had the privilege to enter Post Tenebras Lab (Latin for "after darkness" lab&mdash;a riff off a [common motto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_tenebras_lux) in Geneva) along with fellow Wikimedian/Wikipedian conference attendees Daniel Mietchen, Lane Rasberry, and Andrea Zanni. We had a tour of the infrastructure so far, an in-space-cooked dinner supplied by PTL / coordinated by Andrea, plenty of rousing conversation, and general interest in further collaborations with [BACH](http://ba.chgrp.org/) and [sudo room](http://sudoroom.org/)! To top it off, it turns out PTL has the exact printer necessary for the brand-new mycelia project, based on [Labitrack](http://github.com/labitat/labitrack). As soon as the code is ready, they can be off and running with a decentralized inventory tracking system.
