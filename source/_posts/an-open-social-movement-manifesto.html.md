I have found theories for social movements, especially civil rights, anti-war, and even protest generally, to be wholly insufficient to capture substantial aspects of our current struggle for openness.

Openness is not merely some product of technology, nor is it some new technology itself. Openness affords public good akin to notions of democracy. Both constitute negotiations of appropriate action, and fairness. We have seen various communities organize in support of openness, and it is about time we leverage this network structure&mdash;in fact there is no such luxury to wait:

1.  **Exponential Growth** - The struggle for openness is directly in opposition to the desires of many incumbent institutions and firms, especially those who benefit through money and power/control. There is no time to grow linearly, even by a factor greater than one. For every interval, we need to grow at a greater rate than the previous interval. Next year, we cannot merely double, but rather, we must outpace ourselves from the previous year and prepare to grow even faster the next. This implies:

        *   Time is completely of the essence and we should be wary of delay and derailment strategies that wear us down.*   We must be extremely clever and use all available tools to bend any of our linear growth into exponential ones such as via media that afford ease of coordination, automation and amplification, as well as both traditional and experimental funding mechanisms.

2.  **Diversity of Tactics** - If the first principle can be illustrated by a steep, exponential curve, then this second can be thought of through the _long tail_, the log, or exponential inverse. If we consolidate efforts and rally behind unified fronts, we can produce great results, akin to the beginning "head" component of a log distribution. However, there is substantial value in niche approaches and opportunities, the many small areas where openness can be adopted, often in unique or atypical ways. The sum of the long tail very well may be equivalent in size to the head of the curve.
        *   Consolidation can be advantageous, but exclusively it is antithetical to openness itself. It cannot be the only option.
    *   Perhaps even greater than doubling impact, a diversity of tactics supports positive feedback, a range of ideas and materials that can be fed into other open initiatives in fashions we cannot predict.

3.  **Peer-to-Peer Structure** - Of the many lessons learned from legacy institutions that employ closed and proprietary systems, among them is that concentration of power breeds unfairness and injustice. This lesson must be intuited for openness to succeed. Not only the concession, but the active pursuit of peer-oriented models is the only viable alternative to trading one set of regimes for another, or merely squishing regimes into a slightly smaller, but still dominant position.
        *   Thus we must address hierarchy at every level and work toward deconstructing it, even if it will take time.
    *   We must also commit to resolving conflicts and disputes swiftly through solidarity since divided we currently are conquered.

Some examples:

1.  _[Open Access Manifesto](http://kopimism.org/)_ - Simply put, Aaron was right. This is a moral issue. We have an imperative to reject the rules, and abide by them, however we see fit, in the aim to set information free.2.  _Public Policy_ - It is not the sole struggle of the Openness movement to see results from the political process. All movements for social change today must confront the deep and crippling corruption of the democratic process and state accountability in a global context. We must pursue this avenue, it is not fruitless, but we also cannot lose sight of the need for our movement to operate at every level.3.  _Infrastructure_ - Every bit counts. When we have the opportunity, or the privilege, we must invest in building lasting, or temporary, infrastructure to support openness. This means: open a hackerspace, donate to good causes, find ways to hack livelihood for yourselves and others to do things in the open, engage in public discourse, engage in politics at the local level up, make art and express yourself creatively in ways that promote openness, buy land, buy businesses, buy banks&mdash;_set it all free!_
