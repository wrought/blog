While in town for [WikiConference USA](http://wikiconferenceusa.org/) I had the pleasure of spending a bit of extra time in New York City. Some kind souls were generous enough to spend their time with me, showing their spaces, answering questions, and generally mutually sharing our experiences. One such group who opened their doors and obliged an extended conversation is [ABC No Rio](http://abcnorio.org/).

I stopped by the space previously, but no one was around, so I glanced at various (past and present) event postings on flyers and posters around the doors, though I couldn't make it to any I saw. However, I _was_ able to step inside once I had a chance to schedule a conversation with two long-term volunteers of the space, who also are board members for the 501(c)3 non-profit organization that supports it. This organization exists primarily to keep ABC No Rio's physical location in community control, coordinate fund-raising for improvements (see notes about [re-build](#rebuild) below), and to otherwise support the continued existence of the community. Otherwise, all the function of the space itself is performed by individual volunteers through the various sub-collectives of ABC No Rio, and one non-profit tenant of the building.

Genuinely, ABC is a commons, though one that has seen fluctuating usage and emphases over the years. A group and place that has remained open for 30 years, spanning not only societal eras, but eras all their own. Currently, there are the following collectives in the space:

* Visual Arts
    * Run gallery space at entrance
* Music Performances (esp. punk)
    * Double gallery as music venue
* Free jazz / improv
    * Also use gallery space for performances
* Zine library
    * Upstairs half floor
* Dark Room
    * Upstairs half floor
* Screenprinting
    * Upstairs half floor
* Computer Lab

Plus one partner organization leasing space in the basement:

* Time's Up (bike workshop)

###Rebuild

ABC No Rio owns its current building on Rivington Street in the Lower East Side. It was never in perfect condition, and though it remains functional and accessible, today more than ever it needs attention. Luckily, they are now closer than ever to raising the total ~$7 million to create a brand new building, with a much improved design. They seek connections, donor referrals, and donations.
