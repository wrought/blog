I have begun to discuss with some local folks about a nascent hackerspace in the east bay area. More details on that forthcoming. Reviewing some of our messages about this, I found an interesting little ditty. I wrote it in a stream of consciousness after an in-person meeting to try to quickly simplify my own mental model of starting a hackerspace.

## Eight Steps to Hackerspace
The overall process I find successful for hackerspaces is:

1. Open up a dialog by meeting regularly, hosting an email list (maybe also a website, wiki, and irc channel).
2. Invite potential members/participants and stakeholders, challenge yourself to be accessible to a wider community, strive for equity and parity.
3. Seek to remain transparent, mutually accountable, and to build stakeholdership and ownership of new members/participants.
4. Set an agenda for each meeting beforehand. Give each item a time limit, adjusting as necessary. Designate a facilitator and note-taker, rotating as necessary (even mid-meeting). Always post the notes afterwards (on email list, wiki, etc). Switch roles, trade off and build comfort, skill, experience collaborating together.
5. Share your individual visions. Collaborate to form a shared vision, based on consent. Write it down. Improve it.
6. Collectively determine the goals that will allow you to accomplish concrete steps toward that shared vision.
7. Value safe space https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space
8. Hack the planet.

## Reflection
Oddly enough, this has little to do with [hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic/) per se! It has more to do with ensuring that your community is best able to express itself in an air of empathy, excitement, and collaboration. It is very easy to close up, to act more like a club, or to lose track of how to remain open, accessible, and fair. It is difficult, however, to remain diligent, awake, and improve as you grow and create your hackerspace. Ultimately, the details of what _kind_ of hacking you do, and what sort of _arrangement_ you make of your space will be important, but not nearly as important as dreaming, together, along with your community, and ensuring that you share portions of these dreams, sufficient to know what directions to go.
