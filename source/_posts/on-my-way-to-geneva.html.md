Writing this on a plane, coasting over the US toward Newark, NJ where I will stay for the evening, catching a connection to Geneva tomorrow morning. Laying it all bare here (that is right folks&mdash;all honesty!), I missed my connecting flight because I showed up (on time) to Oakland Airport (OAK) rather than San Francisco (SFO). &gt;.&lt;

It took me all until I reached the terminals to realize there was no United airline and /no/ flight waiting for me in Oakland. 

Luckily, I doubled-back on BART all the way to SFO, which took about 1 hour and 45 minutes, in time to at least catch a flight out to the east coast, where I can pick an early flight in the morning to Switzerland.

All is well that ends well right? There was no charge and the adventure indeed has begun.
