The first thing you must do, no alternative, is to remember (not merely believe, but to recall something utterly meaningful, which rests deep within your thoughts and experiences), you must remember that:

> the world is not as it may seem

You learned this lesson very young, making assumptions about the world that quickly worked themselves out of utility, out of fashion, out of mind.

Please, soak in this notion, in the impossibility of total understanding, seeing, knowing.

How _easy_ is it to **forget** that at any given moment, perhaps, someone is [pulling the wool over your eyes](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pull+the+wool+over+someone's+eyes)? How easy is it to accept (without justification) that the world as we know it is the "only way it can be"? We are strongly biased. We assume the current state of affairs offers the only possibility for life, society, everything. We are all susceptible to such thinking, but we know well the feeling of emptiness it brings.

We know the "truth" is that each of us, individually, live restricted and exploited lives; lives disrupted in both practical and psychological senses. We often deny ourselves and each other the liberty of even _imagining_ new aspects of the world, those things yet to be seen. We spend much time repeating viscious cycles and promoting the status quo or dominant culture, at times in that "whatever's easiest" mentality.

Although it is practically impossible to predict the future, we still live our day-to-day lives as though most of everything exists somewhere above our heads, pre-determined, immutable, out of our control, as though there is some  *natural* order. What a dangerous, false thought.

It is integral to set ourselves free, one by one, to accept there is no singular truth, and certainly no "correct" universe. Nor is the universe immutable&mdash;stuck in its current state, without alternatives.

Our reality is multiplicitous and duplicitous. Our reality consists of many, overlapping worlds. And these worlds are not always truthful. We continuously construct our own memories, knowledge, life. Through social dimensions we constitute shared realities&mdash;sometimes (tragically) through domination, yet other times through consent, or something in between.

People, on the whole, are more creative than we often give credit; just imagine what creative potential we deny or ignore! Instead, we have the ability to accept or support one another in our creativity.

It is time to embrace, celebrate this basic understanding of truth and the world. From it so much flows, and so interesting life then becomes.
